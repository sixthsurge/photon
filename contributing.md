## on pull requests

Please don't PR full features or stylistic changes; I much prefer that people fork the project for 
these things.
This is because it's uncomfortable for me to say no but I don't want people to do these things for 
me because I want to do them myself.
Even if your implementation of something is far better than I could come up with, I'd still rather 
it not be in Photon because it's my project after all.
That said, I certainly appreciate pull requests for translations, small fixes or block mappings.
However I may ignore your pull request for a long time.
