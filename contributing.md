## Contribution guide

- Code contributions to help improve Photon are very appreciated, however: **please** ask me (sixthsurge) **before** you start working on a major contribution (e.g. new feature or stylistic change) and be wary that I am very picky when it comes to accepting code so I may decide not to accept it anway. This is to avoid upset in the situation where you spend a long time working on something and I decide not to merge it.
- As for smaller changes like bug fixes, `block.properties` additions or translations, these will likely be accepted anyway.
- Use the #development channel in my Discord server to discuss potential or ongoing development.
